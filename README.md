I present to you the code of a personal project where I made a login/register page, with data being transfered to phpMyAdmin, using InfinityFree hosting, using PHP Code. 
After the user registers or logs in, the user will be transfered to the personal dashboard, with a control sidebar, where he can edit his profile, as well as seeing his profile details and settings for it.
Keep in mind this is just a prototype to showcase pure PHP code, functionality using Javascript, SQL and connections to database, the design and security (e.g. password hash) were not a priority.
Feel free to use everything you need if you get stuck in your PHP code, all worked for me, but edit for your own host details.

NOT ALL PAGES WERE BUILT, YOU WILL FIND MANY OPTIONS IN THE CONTROL BAR ON THE DASHBOARD, BUT ONLY 3 OF THEM WORK: DASHBOARD, SETTINGS AND USER
