# loginpagewithdashboard
I present to you the code of a personal project where I made a login/register page, with data being transfered to phpMyAdmin, using XAMPP, using PHP Code. 
After the user registers or logs in, he will be transfered to his own dashboard, with a control sidebar, where he can edit his profile, as well as seeing his profile details.
Keep in mind this is just a prototype to showcase PHP code, and connections to database, as well as some scripts and design.
Feel free to use everything you need if you get stuck in your PHP code, all worked for me, but edit for your own host details.
