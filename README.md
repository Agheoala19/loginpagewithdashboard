# User Form and Dashboard

This project is my first personal web application, built to demonstrate fundamental functionality using **pure PHP**, **MySQL**, and **JavaScript**. It includes user registration, login, and a basic dashboard with user profile management.

## Project Overview

The application consists of:

- A **Login/Register** page with form validation.
- **User data storage** via PHP in a **phpMyAdmin** MySQL database.
- A **dashboard** page available after login or registration.
- A **sidebar** menu that includes options such as:
  - Dashboard (Main)
  - User (View/Edit Profile)
  - Settings (Basic configuration options)

> Note: Most links in the sidebar are **placeholders**. Only **Dashboard**, **User**, and **Settings** pages are functional.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP** – Server-side scripting
- **MySQL (phpMyAdmin)** – Database management
- **HTML/CSS** – Structure and basic styling
- **JavaScript** – Client-side functionality
- **SQL** – Data storage and retrieval

## Key Notes

- This is a **prototype** to demonstrate backend connectivity and dynamic behavior.
- Security features (e.g., **password hashing**, **input sanitization**) were **not implemented**, as the focus was on basic functionality.
- The **design/UI** is minimal and may need improvements for production use.
- **Database connection details** are hardcoded and may need to be adjusted to match your hosting environment.

## Getting Started

1. Import the provided SQL structure into your local `phpMyAdmin`.
2. Edit the database connection credentials in the PHP files as needed (`db.php` or similar).
3. Launch the `index.php` file in a local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
4. Register a new user or log in using existing credentials.
5. Explore the functional sections of the dashboard.
